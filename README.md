ðŸ‘‹ This is a standing invitation: If you want to talk crypto (in particular identity), I want to talk to you :)

TLDR:
- I like getting messages
- I like reading things
- I like building products
- I like meeting people at conferences
- I like meeting people when Iâ€™m on work trips

I also take notes on various things (_mostly notes-to-self_). They are incomplete by default, but if you're interested I share them to learn in public. You can find all my notes here: https://gist.github.com/0xarthurxyz.
